\title{Filter movement trajectories based on speed and turning angles}
\usage{
trackFilt(
  x,
  y,
  time.stamp,
  max.speed = Inf,
  max.turn.step = 15,
  max.turn.ang = 15,
  rounds = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of x-coordinates (easting) in UTM.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of y-coordinates (northing) in UTM.}

\item{time.stamp}{A vector of timestamps in \code{POSIXct} format, corresponding
to each location.}

\item{max.speed}{A numeric value specifying the maximum allowed speed (m/s).
Locations that result in speeds above this threshold will be removed.
Defaults to \code{Inf} (effectively no filtering).}

\item{max.turn.step}{A numeric value specifying the minimum step length
(meters) to be considered in trajectory spike detection. Steps longer
than this threshold will be used in the turning angle filter. Defaults
to \code{15} meters.}

\item{max.turn.ang}{A numeric value (in degrees) specifying the minimum
turning angle that defines a trajectory spike. A spike is detected when
two consecutive steps are longer than \code{max.turn.step} and the turning
angle is more acute than \code{max.turn.ang}. Defaults to \code{15} degrees.}

\item{rounds}{An integer specifying the number of filtering iterations.
Defaults to \code{1}.}
}
\value{
A logical vector of the same length as \code{x} and \code{y}, indicating
whether each location is retained (\code{TRUE}) or removed (\code{FALSE}).
}
\description{
This function filters movement trajectories by removing unrealistic
locations based on speed thresholds and trajectory spikes. Spikes are
defined as consecutive long steps with sharp turning angles, which may
indicate erroneous position fixes.
